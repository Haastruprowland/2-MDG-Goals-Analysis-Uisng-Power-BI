# 2-MDG-Goals-Analysis-Uisng-Power-BI
An Analysis of 2 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the top 10 GDP African nations

**Introduction**
Two 2030 MDGs including "Access to electricity" and "ease of doing business" in the African countries with the top 10 GDP on the continent were analysed over a 12-year period of 2008-2020.
The top 10 GDP countries include Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania in alphabetical order with Nigeria having the highest GDP & Ghana with the least.
Attached is the .pbix file showing the dashboard and excel files used in the analysis. The files were obtained from the WorldBank database and analysis done wholly on Microsoft Power BI. The Ease of doing business data on the worldbank database is only available for 2015-2020.

**Objectives**
1. To analyse/assess the progress made by these powerful African countries as regards the 2 MDG focus.
2. To understand the impact of access to electricity on the ease of doing business
3. To understand the impact of GDP on access to electricity and ease of doing business

**Observation & Result**
Egypt & Morocco are 3rd & 6th highest in terms of GDP but the citizens have up to 100% access to electricity, while Nigeria with the highest GDP in Africa has just 55% of her population having access to electricity. Morocco has the highest of doing business of 73% while Nigeria is 57%, however with a steady growth over a 5-year period (2015-2020).
Ghana with the least GDP has % access to electricity of up to 86% with a 60% ease of doing business. Kenya has had an impressive 200% growth in GDP over the last 12-year period with a corresponding growth rate in % access to electricity of 130% as well as a growth in % ease of doing business of 26% over a 5-year period (2015 - 2020) up to 73%. Algeria's GDP has declined at a slow & steady rate over the 12-year period but maintained a 100% access to electricity and a slow growth in % ease of doing business of 9% over the 5-year period

**Conclusion**
The analysis could not completely determine the level of impact of a growing or good GDP on access to electricity but it does have some positive impact on the ease of doing business; however it could be concluded that a growing or good access to electricity has some direct positive impact on the ease of doing business too. To come to a absolute conclusion on this, there is a need to have a look at some other factors that could better shed some more light on these relationships.
